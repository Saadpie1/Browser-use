Plugin System

A robust and extensible plugin system for modular functionality integration.

Overview

The plugin system provides a standardized way to extend the application’s functionality through plugins. It features:
	•	Dependency Injection
	•	Manifest-Based Configuration
	•	State Management
	•	Security Validation
	•	UI Integration
	•	Error Handling

These features ensure that plugins are easy to develop, maintain, and integrate seamlessly with the core application.

Architecture

Core Components
	1.	Plugin Base (PluginBase):
	•	Abstract Base Class: Defines the plugin interface.
	•	Manifest-Based Configuration: Plugins are configured via manifest.yaml.
	•	State Persistence: Automatically handles loading and saving plugin state.
	•	Security Validation: Ensures plugins adhere to required permissions.
	•	Input Sanitization: Protects against injection attacks.
	•	Lifecycle Hooks: Provides hooks (on_init, on_enable, on_disable, on_unload) for managing plugin behavior during different stages.
	2.	Plugin Factory (PluginFactory):
	•	Instantiation Handling: Creates plugin instances with injected configurations.
	•	Manifest Loading and Validation: Reads and validates manifest.yaml files.
	•	Plugin Class Discovery: Dynamically discovers and loads plugin classes.
	•	Error Handling: Logs and manages errors during the plugin loading process.
	3.	Plugin Manager (PluginManager in __init__.py):
	•	Lifecycle Management: Manages the enabling, disabling, loading, and unloading of plugins.
	•	Configuration Management: Handles global and plugin-specific configurations.
	•	Security Enforcement: Applies global security settings and enforces plugin-specific permissions.

Features
	•	Manifest-Based Configuration:
	•	Version Compatibility: Ensures plugins are compatible with the application’s version.
	•	Plugin Metadata: Defines plugin name, version, description, author, and license.
	•	Configuration Settings: Allows setting plugin-specific configurations.
	•	Security Requirements: Specifies required permissions for each plugin.
	•	State Management:
	•	Persistent Storage: Automatically loads and saves plugin state to state.json.

	•	UI Integration:
	•	Gradio-Based UI Components: Leverages Gradio for building interactive UIs.
	•	Tab-Based Interface: Organizes plugin UIs into tabs for better user experience.
	•	Dynamic UI Creation: Allows plugins to create and modify UI elements dynamically.
	•	Error Handling: Ensures UI failures in plugins do not crash the entire application.
	•	Error Handling:
	•	Graceful Failure Recovery: Ensures the application remains stable even if a plugin fails.
	•	Detailed Error Logging: Provides comprehensive logs for debugging.
	•	Plugin Isolation: Keeps plugin errors contained.
	•	Version Validation: Validates plugin compatibility during loading.

Creating a Plugin

Follow these steps to create and integrate a new plugin into the system.
	1.	Create a New Plugin Directory:
Navigate to the plugins/ directory and create a new folder for your plugin.

plugins/
└── your_plugin/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── your_plugin.py
    └── manifest.yaml


	2.	Create Required Files:
	•	__init__.py:
An empty file to make Python treat the directory as a package.
	•	your_plugin.py:
Implement your plugin class here.
	•	manifest.yaml:
Define your plugin’s metadata and configuration.
	3.	Implement the Plugin Class:

# plugins/your_plugin/your_plugin.py

from plugins.plugin_base import PluginBase
import gradio as gr
from typing import Optional, Dict, Any

class YourPlugin(PluginBase):
    def __init__(self, manifest: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None):
        super().__init__(manifest=manifest)
        # Initialize plugin-specific attributes here

    def is_enabled(self) -> bool:
        return self.enabled

    def create_ui(self, main_tabs: gr.Tabs) -> None:
        """Create your UI components here."""
        with main_tabs:
            with gr.TabItem("Your Plugin"):
                gr.Markdown(f"## {self.name} v{self.version}")
                gr.Markdown(f"_{self.description}_")
                # Add more UI elements as needed


	4.	Create the Manifest:

# plugins/your_plugin/manifest.yaml

name: Your Plugin
version: 1.0.0
description: A brief description of your plugin.
min_webui_version: 1.0.0
author: Your Name
license: MIT

config:
  enabled: true

security:
  required_permissions:
    - network_access
  sanitize_all_inputs: true

dependencies:
  - gradio>=3.50.0
  - pyyaml>=6.0.0

	•	Fields Explained:
	•	name: The display name of your plugin.
	•	version: Plugin version following semantic versioning.
	•	description: A short description of what your plugin does.
	•	min_webui_version: Minimum compatible version of the core application.
	•	author: Your name or organization.
	•	license: Licensing information.
	•	config: Plugin-specific configurations.
	•	security: Permissions and security settings.
	•	dependencies: Python packages required by your plugin.

	5.	Manage Plugin Dependencies:
Dependencies listed in manifest.yaml are automatically installed when the plugin is loaded, provided auto_install_deps is enabled in the manifest’s config.
Note:
For production environments, it’s recommended to manage dependencies externally to maintain consistency and avoid runtime installation issues.

Testing

The system includes comprehensive tests covering various aspects of plugin functionality.

Running Tests

Execute the test suite using the following command:

python -m unittest plugins/tests/test_plugin_loader.py

Test Coverage Includes:
	•	Plugin Creation and Loading:
Ensures plugins are correctly instantiated and loaded based on their manifests.
	•	Manifest Injection:
Validates that manifests are properly injected into plugins during initialization.
	•	Lifecycle Management:
Tests the correct invocation of lifecycle hooks (on_init, on_enable, on_disable, on_unload).
	•	Security Validation:
Checks that plugins adhere to specified security permissions.
	•	Version Compatibility:
Verifies that plugins are compatible with the core application’s version.
	•	UI Integration:
Ensures that plugins can successfully create and integrate their UI components.
	•	Error Handling:
Tests the system’s ability to handle and log errors gracefully without affecting the core application.

Recommendation:
Extend the test suite to cover edge cases, such as concurrency during dependency installation and handling malformed manifests.

## Dependency Management

The plugin system now includes enhanced dependency management features:

### Configuration
Dependencies can be specified in the manifest.yaml:
```yaml
config:
  enabled: true
  auto_install_deps: true  # Enable automatic dependency installation

dependencies:
  - package: "gradio>=3.50.0"
  - package: "pyyaml>=6.0.0"
```

### Features
1. **Automatic Installation**:
   - Dependencies are installed when plugin is loaded
   - Only if auto_install_deps is enabled
   - Uses pip for package management

2. **Version Management**:
   - Checks existing package versions
   - Only updates if needed
   - Supports >= version constraints
   - Preserves existing packages when possible

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Logs installation progress
   - Prevents plugin loading on failure
   - Provides detailed error messages

### Test Coverage
New tests have been added to verify:
- Dependency installation
- Version checking
- Installation skipping when satisfied
- Error handling for invalid dependencies
- Disabled dependency installation

Note: For production environments, consider managing dependencies externally for better control and consistency.
