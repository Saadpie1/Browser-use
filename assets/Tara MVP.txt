For TARA’s Minimum Viable Product (MVP), we need to focus on core automation features that immediately provide value while keeping the build lean. Here’s what the TerraCore (TARA’s foundational system) should include for both salon professionals and solopreneur consultants in its first phase.

✅ Customer Interaction Handling
* Basic AI assistant (SLM-powered) that:
   * Responds to common inquiries.
   * Confirms appointments and sends reminders.
   * Collects and stores client preferences & history.

B. Payment & Invoice Automation
✅ Simple Invoice Generation & Tracking
* Allow users to send invoices manually or auto-generate them after an appointment.
* Integrate with Stripe, Square, or QuickBooks.
* Track paid vs. unpaid invoices and send reminders.

2. What’s NOT in the MVP (Yet)
🚫 Advanced analytics & reporting dashboards (will come later).
🚫 Full financial tracking beyond invoices (initially, we only automate invoicing).
🚫 AI-powered pricing recommendations for consultants (we’ll add after user testing).

3. How Fast Can We Build This?
* Weeks 1-2: Backend setup (SLM model, API integrations, database).
* Weeks 3-4: Frontend dashboard & chatbot interface.
* Week 5: Beta testing with a small group of salon owners & consultants.
Would you want the first version to be invite-only to test with a small user group, or go straight to a wider beta launch?
